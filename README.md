# **DOWNRIGHT EXCESSIVE RENAMING PROJECT**

**IMPORTANT:** Read the **Load Order Instructions** for tips on how to sort DERP with item replacer mods.  
Otherwise your items might have the wrong names…  
OK, maybe it’s not that important.

# **Features**

## **UI**

-   Fixes proper title case and spacing issues in some mission titles, menus, HUD, and interactions.
-   Changes the wording for some miscellaneous items, stash points, and map areas.
-   Removes the year from Elustive Target titles.
-   Choose to change the Completed/Failed Objective Status into Pass/Fail, Complete/Incomplete, Successful/Unsuccessful, or even Yarp/Narp.
-   Change the lengthy “Not Detected During Frisk” tag to something a little shorter like Concealable, Passes Frisk, Unfriskable, etc.
-   Choose how to fix the mismatched Griswold/Hanson property and items on Whittleton Creek.
-   Removes the ICA from mission Playstyle titles and even choose to replace one of them with Silent Assassin.
    -   **Warning:** outside of Freelancer the SA replacement options create a second occurrence of Silent Assassin **_in name only_**.  
        It’s still functions as the original rank. So you may want to stick with the Remove ICA option.

## **Freelancer**

# **Installation**

-   Install DERP using Simple Mod Framework just like any other mod.
-   Look through all the config options in DERP to decide what you want to change. The individual suit options and “realistic” firearms options in particular can drastically alter names. It can take some time to get used to the changes when scavenging firearms during Freelancer missions.
-   Read the **Load Order Instructions** for tips on how to sort DERP with an item replacer mod that also renames the item.
-   I highly recommend also using [Heritage UI](https://www.nexusmods.com/hitman3/mods/323). They make the menus and HUD far more legible and not shouting in **ALL CAPS EVERYWHERE. SERIOUSLY, WHO THOUGHT THIS WAS A GOOD IDEA? THIS IS HORRIBLY ANNOYING TO READ AND TAKES UP TOO MUCH SPACE ON SCREEN**. Also, my hundreds of capitalization changes will go unnoticed without one of those mods.
-   Finally deploy all your mods with the Apply button. (Only included because there _will be_ people who forget this.)

## **Load Order Instructions**

If you’re using a replacer mod that also renames that item, you’ve got decisions to make.

-   If DERP **has** an individual naming option for your suit/weapon/gear, and you **_like_** one of the available choices:
    1.  Select the name you want to use.
    2.  Then place your mod **_higher_** than DERP in SMF’s load order.
-   If DERP **has** an individual naming option for your suit/weapon/gear, and you **_don’t_** like one of the available choices:
    -   Either: select DERP’s Off choice for the name. That way the load order for the two mods won’t matter.
    -   Or: place your mod **_lower_** than DERP in SMF’s load order.
-   If DERP changes a name but **doesn’t** have an individual option for your item, and you like **_DERP’s name_** better:
    -   Place your mod **_higher_** than DERP in SMF’s load order so DERP’s changes will be used.
-   If DERP changes a name but **doesn’t** have an individual option for your item, and you like **_your mod’s name_** better:
    -   Place your mod **_lower_** than DERP in SMF’s load order so your mod’s changes will be used.

## **Compatibility**

[Heritage UI](https://www.nexusmods.com/hitman3/mods/323): Mostly Compatible HUI’s naming option includes a number of items in DERP also renames. So I’ve set DERP to load after Heritage UI to allow the individual options in DERP to take effect.

[The Great Big Localisation Revamp](https://www.nexusmods.com/hitman3/mods/549): Mostly Compatible Some of the new item names required referring to another renamed item in the descriptions. I’ve set DERP to load after TGBLR to allow the individual options in DERP to take effect.

**Disclaimer and Warranty**

This mod is still in development, not all planned items are included yet. It might _eventually_ have support for more suit/item replacer mods. Others may never have choices for all the available mods (I’m looking at you Signature Suit, Futo, Lynch, and Freedom Phantom). I may add load order sorting rules for replacement mods that DERP has individual options for. That’ll have to wait until I’m sure it won’t completely ruin people’s load orders. Warranty sold separately.
